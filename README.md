The objective of this project is to create awareness of the pervasiveness of
these invisible tracking territories by rendering visible the landscapes of data
surveillance and, through an interactive typographic artwork, to re-imagine this
phenomenon creatively. In defined opposition to the surveillance idea of the
individual as ‘target’ or ‘consumer’, this artwork will suggest a new model for
experiencing the intersection between surveillance and ‘private’ everyday action
through the audience’s informed re-assumption of ownership over their personal
information, and the re-assertion of everyday creativity and informed agency as
we move through and engage with our public spaces.
